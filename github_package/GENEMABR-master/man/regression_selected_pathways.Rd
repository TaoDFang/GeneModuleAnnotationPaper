\usage{
regression_selected_pathways(gene_input, gene_pathway_matrix = NULL,
  lambda = 0.007956622, alpha = 0.5, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{gene_input}{A vecor of genes to be annotated. It should have same ID types(Ensembl ID, HUGO gene symbol) as the genes in \emph{gene_pathway_matrix}.}

\item{gene_pathway_matrix}{A binary background matrix whose columns are the pathways/gene sets and
whose rows are all the genes from pathways/gene sets . It could be in sparse matrix format ((inherit from class "sparseMatrix" as in package Matrix) to save memory.
For gene i and pathway j, the value of matrix(i,j) is 1 is gene i belonging to pathway j otherwise 0.
Users could leave it as default value then  it will use pre-collected gene_pathway_matrix from GO Ontology and REACTOME databaase.
Otherwise, they could use their own customized gene_pathway_matrix}

\item{lambda}{We use glmnet function to do regression. \emph{lambda} is an argument in \strong{glmnet}. See \strong{glmnet} function for more details
Here we use default value 0.007956622 after preliminary study. It can be overridden by giving \emph{nlambda} and \emph{lambda.min.ratio arguments}.}

\item{alpha}{The elasticnet mixing parameter, with \eqn{0~\leq~\alpha~\leq~1}. The penalty is defined as
\eqn{(1-\alpha)/2||\beta||_2^2+\alpha||\beta||_1}.
alpha=1 is the lasso penalty, and alpha=0 the ridge penalty. Default value: 0.5.}

\item{...}{Other paramaters for glmnet function.}
}
\value{
A list of four elements:
\itemize{
  \item selected_pathways_names - Pathways names for selected pathways
  \item selected_pathways_coef - Regression coefficients value for selected pathways
  \item selected_pathways_fisher_pvalue - Fisher exact pvalue for selected pathways
  \item selected_pathways_num_genes - The number of genes for selected pathways in background
}
}
\description{
This function allows you to extracte enriched pathways for gene module/list via regressioin (elastic net) based method
