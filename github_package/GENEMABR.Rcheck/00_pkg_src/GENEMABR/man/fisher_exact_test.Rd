\usage{
fisher_exact_test(selected_pathways, gene_input,
  gene_pathway_matrix = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{selected_pathways}{A vecor of pathways to be used for enrichment analysis for genes in \emph{gene_input}.It should have same ID types(E.g. pathway ID, pathway names) as the pathways in \emph{gene_pathway_matrix}.}

\item{gene_input}{A vecor of genes to be annotated. It should have same ID types(E.g. Ensembl ID, HUGO gene symbol) as the genes in \emph{gene_pathway_matrix}.}

\item{gene_pathway_matrix}{A binary background matrix whose columns are the pathways/gene sets and
whose rows are all the genes from pathways/gene sets . It could be in sparse matrix format ((inherit from class "sparseMatrix" as in package Matrix) to save memory.
For gene i and pathway j, the value of matrix(i,j) is 1 is gene i belonging to pathway j otherwise 0.
Users could leave it as default value then  it will use pre-collected gene_pathway_matrix from GO Ontology and REACTOME databaase.
Otherwise, they could use their own customized gene_pathway_matrix}
}
\value{
A list of two elements:
\itemize{
  \item selected_pathways_fisher_pvalue - Fisher exact pvalue for selected pathways
  \item selected_pathways_num_genes - The number of genes for selected pathways in background
}
}
\description{
This function allows you to compute two sided fish exact pvalue of gene list for selected  pathways
To know more about this method. I recommend you to read the paper (Enrichment or depletion of a GO category within a class of genes: which test?) for more details
