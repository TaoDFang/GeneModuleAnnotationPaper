# Introduction
GENEMABR is  an R package for gene module annotation or gene set enrichment 
analysis via a regression based method.

We formulate the gene set enrichment problem within a regression framework. 
Thus, the problem of gene-set enrichment is transformed into a feature 
selection problem, where the aim is to select the gene sets that best predict
the membership of genes in a given gene set/module. 

Here we propose to apply regularised regression methods, such as lasso 
(l1 regularization),ridge (l2 regularization), or elastic net (hybrid of 
l1 and l2 regularization controlled by the hyperparameter alpha), in order to
adjust the treatment of similar or redundant gene sets.

For more details about this method. Please refer to out paper:(?)
 

# Installation
GENEMABR can be installed from Bioconductor:
```{r, eval= FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly=TRUE)){
    install.packages("BiocManager")}
BiocManager::install("GENEMABR")
```

Altertivly, you can install GENEMABAR via git devltools
```{r}
library(devtools)
install_github("TaoDFang/GENEMABR")
```

The package can be loaded using the `library` command.

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE} 
library(GENEMABR)
```

# Gene module annotation or gene set enrichment analysis via regression based method 
To test a our method, we use a IgAN-associated module from the paper: 
Choobdar,S. et al. (2019) Open Community Challenge Reveals Molecular Network Modules with Key Roles in Diseases. bioRxiv, 265553.

IgAN-associated module identified using the consensus analysis in the InWeb 
protein-protein interaction network. The module comprises immune-related NF-$\kappa$B signaling pathways.

Figure below shows mannually extracted P-values for some important  pathways
from GO Ontology and REACTOME database by using the non-central hypergeometric distribution test.

Read non-central hypergeometric distribution test results from original paper 
for gene module based on GO Ontology and REACTOME pathways
```{r}
hypergeometric_test_results=read.csv(file = "../inst/data_raw/Daniel_S5_mod283.txt",
                                     header = TRUE,sep = "\t")
#filterd results with only P.noncentral value less then 0.05
results_filtered=hypergeometric_test_results[hypergeometric_test_results$P.noncentral<0.05,]

head(results_filtered)
dim(results_filtered)
```

We found traditional non-central hypergeometric distribution test/fisher extact test 
usually return too much over-presented pathways for certain gene module. 

And many of  these pathways are highly related.
For example,four pathways with pvalues less than 0.05: 

immune response-activating cell surface receptor signaling pathway  GO:0002429;

immune response-activating signal transduction GO:0002757 ;

immune response-regulating cell surface receptor signaling pathway GO:0002768;

immune response-regulating signaling pathway: GO:0002764.

[GO:0002757 and GO:0002768 are parents of GO:0002429 and GO:0002764 is parents of GO:0002757 and GO:0002768 ](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/term/GO:0002429)


To get a more sparse results by exploting corraltion between different pathways,
we could use "regression_selected_pathways" function in GENEMABR package.

This function use regularised regression methods to do enrichment analysis, 
such as lasso (l1 regularization), ridge (l2 regularization), or elastic net 
(hybrid of l1 and l2 regularization controlled by the hyperparameter alpha), 
in order to adjust the treatment of similar or redundant gene-sets. 
If two gene-sets are highly redundant, lasso will assign a higher coefficient 
to one of them randomly, ridge will assign equal coefficients to both of them,
whereas elastic net will behave between lasso and ridge.

To use this method, use need to provide a binary gene pathways realationships 
matrix whose columns are the pathways/gene sets and whose rows are all the genes 
from pathways/gene sets.For gene i and pathway j, the value of matrix(i,j) is 1 is gene i belonging to pathway j otherwise 0.

Users could use default gene_pathway_matrix("default") so it will use pre-collected 
gene_pathway_matrix from GO Ontology and REACTOME databaase.Altertatively, Users 
could use their own customized gene_pathway_matrix 
```{r}
#Gene module from the paper
gene_list=c("TRPC4AP","CDC37","TNIP1","IKBKB","NKIRAS2","NFKBIA","TIMM50","RELB",
            "TNFAIP3","NFKBIB","HSPA1A","NFKBIE","SPAG9",
            "NFKB2","ERLIN1","REL","TNIP2","TUBB6","MAP3K8")
#help("regression_selected_pathways")

#Here use regression_selected_pathways with default gene pathway matrix 
#and set the alpha value as 0.5
enrichment_results=regression_selected_pathways(gene_input=gene_list,
                                                gene_pathway_matrix=NULL,alpha=0.5)
enrichment_results
```
From results above, we can find our methods give a much more sparse while biological meaning results.It captures most important NF-kappaB signaling pathways from the gene module

# Other functions in this methods
```{r}
# If you use the default pathway databases(GO Ontologyand REACTOME).
# After you extracted enriched pathways, you can use find_root_ids function
#to find thier GO sub-root or REACTOME roots(ID) to help you better
#understanding the biological meanings of pathways.
#Here we use GO sub-root instead of GO root nodes as there are only 
#three roots in the GO ontology and there are not so specific 
GO_Reactome_root_id=find_root_ids(names(enrichment_results$selected_pathways_coef))
GO_Reactome_root_id

# Or if you want to obatain root notes names instead of ID, you can use function
# from_id2name to get names from ids
GO_Reactome_root_id_names=from_id2name(GO_Reactome_root_id)
GO_Reactome_root_id_names

# Or you  can use function get_steps function to calculate the distance from
#selected pathways to GO or Reactome roots
step2root=get_steps(names(enrichment_results$selected_pathways_coef))
step2root
# To view specic position of GO/REACOTEM pathways in ontology trees.
# You can use Visualization tool at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/ 
# and https://reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/ 
```
